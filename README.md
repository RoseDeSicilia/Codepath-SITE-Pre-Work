Submitted by: **Rose De Sicilia**

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com/edit/#!/daffodil-mirror-blarney)

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn
https://stackoverflow.com/

https://jsfiddle.net/

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

Finding Images
  I wanted my website to have a Harry Potter and quidditch theme to it. So I had to scoure the internet to 
  find Harry Potter themed imgages with a transparent background, which was much more time consuming 
  than I expected. 
Finding/cropping/manipulating audio
  Again, since I wanted my website to be Harry Potter and quidditch themed, I wanted an intro audio related that
  introduced the game. So i searched through quidditch clips on youtube, downloaded them in audio format, and 
  then cropped them to get the sections I wanted. 
  I searched on mozilla developer and geeks for geeks to figure out how to get them to play on intro and it worked!
Implementing online javascript code 
  There were things that I remember seeing on other websites that I wanted to add, such as Ron following the cursor, the 
  sparkle starts following the cursor, or the floating snitch and bludgers. So I scoured stackoverflow, jsfiddle, and google 
  in general, until I found scripts that could do just that. 
Styling 
  Every time I went to style (and center) a component I'd research the different 
  ways to get the compoenent appear how I preferred and played around with differnt examples on online sandboxes. 
  Sometimes, I'd still be there 2 hours later, essnetially having and argument with the css page. 
  But overall, styling was a fun challenge. 
Synchronising button clicks with javascript code
  The languages I have the most experience with are java and python and am very used to a program following a 
  predefined order of steps, with limited user interaction. 
  Seeing how javascript methods are essentially dynamically called when prompted by a certain event really caught me off guard.
  I had to understand what was going on here. I went through many examples to try and wrap my head around this sort of thing. 
  And after seeing enough exaples and playing around with it, I began to see it as interactive method calls, 
  which made the process much easier to understand. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I really want to learn how the backend connects to the front end. This pre work shed light into how interactive websites are made. 
The next thing that I want to learn is how the backend forms a connection to the backend, and how the security of this 
connection is maintained. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I would have an audio play when the page is loaded. 
I would add a timer. 
I would make it possible to switch between players (Harry, Ginny, a Dementor, Dobby, Dumbledore, the weasley twins Fred and George...)
I'd an audio of a crowd cheering Ron everytime he completes a round
I'd an audio of a crowd booing Ron everytime he made a mistake
I'd add a leadership board that holds the name and score of all users who play the game
I'd make the same game with Super Mario Bro's Theme, a SpongeBob Theme, and a Plants Vs. Zombies theme
